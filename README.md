# JW_2024_Clinch-River-Mussles

The intent of this project is to investigate the population dynamics of adjacent mussel beds in the Clinch River whose populations interact non-symmetrically via the movement of glochidia during spread of a pathogen and, separately, while absorbing pollutants from the river.  For the purposes of the initial manuscript, we investigated populations of 5 beds isolated beds and 5 beds embedded in a larger population of 9 beds.  For simplicity, these two scenarios were given separate m-files and are denoted throughout with either a "5" of "9" suffix.  Each file is self-contained and all parameters are set within the file rather than being passed as parameters.
